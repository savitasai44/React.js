<h2>REACT.JS</h2> <br><br>

<h3><b>⚛️ What is React.js?</b></h3><br>
React.js is a JavaScript library used to build User Interfaces (UI).<br>
It was developed by Facebook (Meta) and is one of the most popular tools for frontend development today.<br>

<h3><b>🚀 Main Features of React: </b></h3><br>
1.Component-based → Everything is divided into small, reusable components.<br>
2.JSX (JavaScript + XML) → You can write HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript.<br>
3.Virtual DOM → React updates the UI very fast because it uses a virtual DOM instead of updating the real DOM directly.<br>
4.One-way Data Flow→ Data flows from parent → child, making apps predictable and easier to debug.<br>
5.Reusable Components → Once you build a component, you can use it multiple times.<br>

<h3><b>⚡ How to Install React?</b></h3><br>
Install Node.js (it comes with npm).<br>
Open terminal and run:<br>
npx create-react-app myapp<br>
cd myapp<br>
npm start<br>
